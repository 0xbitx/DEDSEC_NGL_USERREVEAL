## INSTALLATION 
### Forking and Deploying a GitHub Repository as a GitHub Pages Site

This tutorial will guide you through the process of forking a GitHub repository and deploying it as a GitHub Pages site. GitHub Pages allows you to host a website directly from your GitHub repository.

### Step 1: Fork the Repository
1. Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner of this page. This action will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### Step 2: Set Up GitHub Pages

  1.  Go to your forked repository on GitHub.
  2.  Click on the "Settings" tab, usually located next to the "Code" tab.
  3.  Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
  4.  Under "Source," select the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages (typically the "main" branch or "master" if it's still called that).
  5.  Click the "Save" or "Save Changes" button.

## Step 3: Create a Webhook

1. **Select a Server:** First, choose the Discord server where you want to create the webhook. You need appropriate permissions within that server.

2. **Server Settings:** Click on the server name to open the server settings.

3. **Integrations:** In the server settings, select the "Integrations" option from the left-hand menu.

4. **Webhooks:** In the "Integrations" section, you will see a "Webhooks" option. Click on it.

5. **Create Webhook:** Click the "Create Webhook" button.

6. **Name:** Give your webhook a name (DEDSEC NGL TOOL)

7. **Channel:** Choose the channel where you want the webhook messages to be sent. You can create a new channel or use an existing one.

8. **Copy Webhook URL:** After configuring the settings, you will see a "Webhook URL." copy that link

## Step 4: Set Up the index.html
1. edit line 4 (your ngl username) example: @james123
2. edit line 16 (your ngl username) exmaple: @james123
3. edit line 70 (your webhook link)
   
### Step 5: Access Your Deployed NGL Page

After saving the GitHub Pages settings, you'll see a green message indicating that your site is published. It will also provide a URL where you can access your deployed GitHub Pages site (usually in the format https://your-username.github.io/repository-name).
